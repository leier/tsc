Welcome to the Time Series Challenge documentation!
===================================================
This is a time series analysis project, which helps analysing gaps in time series, find segments in the series as well as seasonalities and trends.
As an output modelled segments are given. Please check the notebook '01_Time_Series_Challenge.ipynb' in the notebooks folder containing documentation in markdown.

.. note::
	I am not familar with Sphinx and spent considerable time to get it running, but among other problems autodoc and doctest do not seem to run nicely together. If I may give an unsolicited advice: the following tools are good or better alternatives to Sphinx: swagger UI, pdoc3 or MkDocs. I proceed by using markdown in the notebook 01_Time_Series_Challenge.ipynb in the notebook folder.
