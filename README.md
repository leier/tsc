## Welcome to the Time Series Challenge documentation!

---

This is a time series analysis project, which helps analyzing gaps, finding segments in the time series as well as seasonalities and trends.
As an output modelled segments are given, which one can use to fill gaps, or extrapolate the time series within reason.

Please check the notebook 'notebooks/01_Time_Series_Challenge.ipynb' containing documentation in markdown.
The Sphinx Docs give some additional information. However, since we rely on public libraries mostly, the overall software development setup was not used quite the way it could have in a more advanced project.
